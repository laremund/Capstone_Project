            <h2 class="article_content article_h2s">Setting</h2>

            <p class="article_content article_paragraphs">In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate an energy called Cursed Energy,[Jp. 1] which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Normal people cannot control this flow in their bodies.
                As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses,[Jp. 2] a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These curses are shown as gruesome monsters.
                Jujutsu Sorcerers are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they please and also to reduce its release. High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques, which tend to be unique to the user or their family.
                An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain Expansion,[Jp. 5] through which the user can use their Cursed Energy to build a pocket dimension that covers the surrounding area within which all attacks will be stronger.

            <h2 class="article_content article_h2s">Plot</h2>

            <p class="article_content article_paragraphs">Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club, high schooler Yuuji Itadori spends his days at either the clubroom or the hospital, where he visits his bedridden grandfather. However, this leisurely lifestyle soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a cursed item.
                Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice and negativity—after swallowing the said item, revealed to be a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the "King of Curses."
                Yuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses pose to society as he discovers his own newfound powers. Introduced to the Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, he begins to walk down a path from which he cannot return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer.

            <h2 class="article_content article_h2s">Production</h2>

            <p class="article_content article_paragraphs">In 2017, Gege Akutami published Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School, a 4-chapter series that ran in Jump GIGA from April 28 to July 28.[3][4] This series would serve later as a prequel to Jujutsu Kaisen, being retroactively titled as Jujutsu Kaisen 0.[5] Jujutsu Kaisen debuted in Weekly Shōnen Jump on March 5, 2018.[6]
                Akutami stated that Neon Genesis Evangelion influenced the mythological aspects of the series,[7] being also influenced by horror and found footage films.[8] Akutami is particularly a fan of Yoshihiro Togashi, author of YuYu Hakusho and Hunter × Hunter,[8][9] expressing intentions to have an art style as close as possible to his.[7]
                The author is also a fan of Tite Kubo, author of Bleach, and discussed in an interview with him the similarities between their works.
